# RPM Assessment - Edward Lionte

* This is a console application with a weekly scheduled, repeatable task that downloads weekly U.S. fuel pricing from EIA Open Api and saves it to the database. 

* The apppsetings.json file has a connection string for a LocalDB as well as however many days you wish to lookback for the import.

* Things I would work on or alter further if this were to be an expanded project are as follows:
	- Improve logging and make it more robust.
	- Provide more abstractions of methods and classes.
	- Work on some sort of GUI to help simplify settings management.
